Hello World!
I am Aliu Yusuff Ayobami, a front-end developer. I'm really happy to partake in HNGi7 intership programme. 
I really love it because of some task it has taken me through from the past 24 hours.
Part of the task include this gihub account, in which this is my first repository.
Its not something easy when it get to first timer on something
especially on creating this repostory, but it was successful base tutorial provided on Github itself.
Hope to learn more about this github as it will be useful for me mostly as a developer.
I wish my intern with HNGi7 yeild me and the HNG itself a success.
Thanks.
